				<h2 >Lehane Foundation</h2>
			<p>Ever felt sad for a person or a stray dog on roadside or near by your locality starving for food? So did we, back then we were young
                and helpless , the most we could do was buying a biscuit packet for that dog or giving the person some little change that we had , 
                but now, we along with your help want to do something we are representting your every bit of generosity in giving to the needy.
			</p>
			<p>This is what the founder of Lehane Foundation <span>EDLA MANICHANDANA</span> is saying. Edla Manichandana along with her 5 friends Keerthana, Saranya , Monika
			, Prathyusha and Shirlene has set up this foundation in 2020 during the time of COVID-19 lockdown.They were in their second year of graduation at that time.
			 </p>
			 <p>At the beginning Lehane Foundation is being recognised only by their friends ,relatives , classmates, schoolmates 
				 through which they started receiving funds. At the very next moment they received funds ,they started to help as much as they can by collaborating with some
				other organisations as Social distancing was compulsary at that time and people were not allowed outside without any permission.</p>
